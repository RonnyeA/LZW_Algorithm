This folder contains the 5 files of at least 1MB that I used for testing. The compressionComparison Excel file has the comparison of each file. I did not know how to create a script file to run all the test files at the same time so it will have to be done manually by changing a line in Encoder.java. There is more information in the encoder README regarding this.
